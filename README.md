# Bird-Classification-Model
This project is a deep learning model for object recognition built using the ResNet50 architecture and TensorFlow. The ResNet50 architecture is renowned for its efficiency and accuracy in image classification tasks, making it an ideal choice for this project. By leveraging transfer learning, we take advantage of pre-trained weights from the ResNet50 model, fine-tuning it to recognize birds given in our dataset.

The custom built dataset contains training data which has 10 folders for 10 birds and each folder has 800 images and the validation data also contains 10 folders for 10 birds and each folder has 2000 images. We have also included a test dataset to evaluate the performance of the model.

The results of the model were

Accuracy: 95.59 Precision: 95.56 Recall: 95.59 F1 Score: 95.59
